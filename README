In this repository are two MATLAB computing excersizes I created in my ECE 213 Continuous Time Signals class.

The first excersize computes and and plots the Analytical and Numerical Convolutions of the output voltage of an RC circuit.
The convolution of two signals is just a mathmatical way to create a third signal from the first two.
