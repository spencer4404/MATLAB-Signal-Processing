# ECE-213

In this repository are two MATLAB computing excersizes I created in my ECE 213 Continuous Time Signals class.

The first excersize computes and and plots the Analytical and Numerical Convolutions of the output voltage of an RC circuit.
The convolution of two signals is just a mathmatical way to create a third signal from the first two.

The second excersize takes resistance, inductance, and capacitance inputs and will compute and plot the impulse response of that RLC circuit
An impulse response is how the circuit responds when an impulse signal, a signal with infinite slope at 0, is applied to the input
